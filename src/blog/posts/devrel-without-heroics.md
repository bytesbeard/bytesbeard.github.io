I used to treat DevRel like a performance.

Ship something. Promote it. Host something. Check the views and record them. Repeat.

And then I'd wonder why it felt fragile—why the whole thing depended on me pushing a boulder uphill every month.

Eventually you learn the painful truth:

> **If your DevRel program needs your personality to function, it's not a program. It's a show.**

So I started designing it like an operating system.

### Mechanisms are not "process"

When I say mechanisms, I don't mean bureaucracy.

A mechanism is a system that:

* produces a result repeatedly
* with predictable inputs
* even when the humans are tired

DevRel needs mechanisms because it's always under pressure:

* prove impact
* keep cadence
* feed pipeline
* keep community trust
* and do it without turning into a marketing megaphone

### The forcing functions that changed everything for me

Here are the forcing functions I now use (and I wish I used sooner):

#### 1) The "Demo Slot Contract"

For AI Tinkerers-style events, the product is not attendance.
The product is **demos**.

So we treat demo slots like inventory:

* limited slots
* clear expectations
* lightweight screening (to keep quality high)
* "work-in-progress welcome" stated explicitly

**Forcing function:** you cannot announce the event publicly until you have at least potential *X* demos confirmed.

This prevents the worst pattern: big crowd, empty stage.

#### 2) The 48-hour Retro

Every event gets a retro within 48 hours. Not a "whenever."

Template is fixed:

* what worked
* what broke
* what surprised us
* who should we invite next time
* which 3 people do we follow up with and why

**Forcing function:** retro happens before the next event is planned.

That's how learning compounds.

#### 3) The "Follow-up Minimum"

The easiest lie in DevRel is: "people loved it".

The antidote is follow-up.

After every event:

* pick 10 people (not 100)
* send a personal follow-up or structured form
* ask: *what did you do next?*

An alternative approach is to monitor the whatsapp/telegram groups that your community discusses and rants in and quitly observe discussions on the last event.

No discussion is worse than seeing negative feedback or rants.

**Forcing function:** no next event announcement until follow-up is done.

You'd be surprised how quickly your outcomes become visible when you simply ask.

#### 4) The Speaker Pipeline Board

Speakers don't appear magically. Builders don't either.

So I keep a simple board:

* potential demo candidates
* "warm intros"
* first-time attendees worth nurturing
* repeat speakers to invite back
* "quiet killers" (great builders who don't self-promote)

**Forcing function:** every event, move 3-5 people forward one step.

DevRel is just relationships operationalized.

#### 5) The "Metric Review Rhythm"

Have a system for Monthly metric reviews at your team level, if not a weekly touch point with your manager on reviewing them.

Want to keep them efective and quick? Do them as 15-minute blocks:
* returning builders trend
* speaker pipeline count
* demos confirmed for next event
* 3 follow-ups completed
* one insight

**Forcing function:** metrics must fit on one screen.

If it needs a slide deck, it's too late.

### What I measure when I'm being brutally honest

Not what looks impressive. What changes decisions:

* **Returning builder rate**: do people come back?
* **First-time → demo conversion**: do we create new voices?
* **Repeat speaker rate**: do builders trust us with their work?
* **Collaboration sparks**: intros that turned into action
* **Time-to-ship**: how quickly we can run a quality program

And the real hidden one:

* **Organizer fatigue index** (yes, seriously)

Because a burned-out DevRel lead destroys compounding.

### The AWS-era lesson that still applies

At AWS, the scale is bigger. The resources are bigger. The visibility is bigger.

And yet the same fragility exists if you don't have mechanisms.

If your program depends on:

* one charismatic speaker
* one flagship event
* one quarter of budget
* one influencer partnership

…then the program isn't resilient. It's lucky and is run by a "showman".

Mechanisms make it resilient.

### The punchline

Metrics are not the thing.

Mechanisms are the thing.

Metrics are simply how you can tell whether your mechanisms work — without lying to yourself.
