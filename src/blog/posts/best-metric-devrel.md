title: The Best Metric Wasn't on My Dashboard
description: The Metric I Discovered After a Recent Event.

After a recent builder-style event, I did the usual thing:
count RSVPs, attendance, questions, photos, posts.

Looks good. Everyone's happy.

But the real signal hit me later — in the most unglamorous way possible.

It was the **quality of follow-up messages**.

Not the quantity. The quality.

I got a few messages that basically said:

* "I finally shipped a demo because I saw someone else show unfinished work."
* "I met someone who solved the exact problem I'm stuck on."
* "I'm bringing a teammate next time because this wasn't fluff."

That's not engagement. That's **permission**.

Permission to:

* show work-in-progress
* ask for help without embarrassment
* build in public without turning into an influencer

And then I realized the metric I wanted was:

> **How many people left feeling braver about their work?**

That's not a vanity metric.
That's the start of an ecosystem.

So now I track a proxy:

* **WIP submissions** (work-in-progress demos)
* **first-time demo rate**
* **returning builders**
* **# of follow-ups that mention a next step**

Because when people leave with a next step, the community stops being an event series and starts becoming infrastructure.

And that's the only kind of DevRel I'm interested in building.
